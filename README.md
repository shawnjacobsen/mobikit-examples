# Mobikit Examples

This repository contains some examples of applications built using the [Mobikit Platform](https://www.mobikit.io/).

## Example Directory

Open the example's folder for more information on how to run it.

### Realtime Demo

The [realtime-demo](./realtime-demo) folder contains the source code of [realtime-demo.mobikit.io](https://realtime-demo.mobikit.io/). This application uses the [Mobikit JS client](https://github.com/mobikitinc/mobikit-js) to stream live location data from a user's browser into Mobikit.

### Bus Alert

The [bus-alert](./bus-alert) folder contains a script to ingest live CABS bus data into Mobikit, and explains how to create a Mobikit automation to trigger actions based on the data.

### Rideshare

The [rideshare](./rideshare) folder contains a full end-to-end example of how to use Mobikit with a web app and an web server. This app is similar to a stripped-down version of an app like Uber, where riders request a ride and are then paired with a nearby driver.

This application uses both the [Mobikit JS client](https://github.com/mobikitinc/mobikit-js) and the [Mobikit Python Client](https://pypi.org/project/mobikit/).

### Python Streaming Data

The [python-stream-data](./python-stream-data) folder contains a simple Python utility to stream data into Mobikit.
